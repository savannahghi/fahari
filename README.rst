Environment variables
---------------------

The minimal environment variables needed to run this project are::

  export DATABASE_URL="postgres://app:app@localhost:5432/mle"
  export CELERY_BROKER_URL="redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0"
  export USE_DOCKER=no

The `DATABASE_URL` and `CELERY_BROKER_URL` should naturally be set to values that work for your local development environment.

Pre-Commit Hooks
-----------------

Code quality checks are run via https://pre-commit.com/ . You'll have a better experience if you install Pre-Commit and set up the Git hook.

GPG Signing
------------

As a contributor, you need to sign your commits: https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits .

Running
--------

In order to serve static assets for local development, you need to set up an `npm` development server:

First, you need to install `npm`. We recommend `nvm`: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm .

```bash
> npm install
> npm run dev
```

Settings
--------

Moved to settings_.

Basic Commands
--------------

Setting Up Your Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

* To create an **superuser account**, use this command::

    $ python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

Live reloading and Sass CSS compilation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Moved to `Live reloading and SASS compilation`_.

.. _`Live reloading and SASS compilation`: http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/live-reloading-and-sass-compilation.html

Celery
^^^^^^

This app comes with Celery.

To run a celery worker:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd pepfar_mle
    celery -A config.celery_app worker -l info

Please note: For Celery's import magic to work, it is important *where* the celery commands are run. If you are in the same folder with *manage.py*, you should be right.

Email Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In development, it is often nice to be able to see emails that are being sent from your application. For that reason local SMTP server `MailHog`_ with a web interface is available as docker container.

Container mailhog will start automatically when you will run all docker containers.
Please check `cookiecutter-django Docker documentation`_ for more details how to start all containers.

With MailHog running, to view messages that are sent by your application, open your browser and go to ``http://127.0.0.1:8025``

Custom Bootstrap Compilation
^^^^^^

The generated CSS is set up with automatic Bootstrap recompilation with variables of your choice.
Bootstrap v4 is installed using npm and customised by tweaking your variables in ``static/sass/custom_bootstrap_vars``.

You can find a list of available variables `in the bootstrap source`_, or get explanations on them in the `Bootstrap docs`_.
Bootstrap's javascript as well as its dependencies is concatenated into a single file: ``static/js/vendors.js``.
